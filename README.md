# Disney_movies_analysis
Disney has been pioneer in animated movies and has evolved the film industry with its creative projects. We all have some favorites from Disney and if you have loved animation movie, you can't ignore Disney and the powerful characters it has created.

In this project, I have explored the movies data of disney prepared by Kelly Garet, available publicly at https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16 
I have analyzed the movies trend and tried to understand why a particular genre is more in trend and what should be Disney's next bet on (genre wise).
